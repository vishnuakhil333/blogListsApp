### Resources

#### Data Fetch URLs

- `https://apis.ccbp.in/blogs`
- `https://apis.ccbp.in/blogs/[id]`

    **Example:**

    ```js
    const apiUrl = `https://apis.ccbp.in/blogs/1`
    ```

> ### _Things to Keep in Mind_
>
> - All components you implement should go in the `src/components` directory.
> - Don't change the component folder names as those are the files being
>   imported into the tests.
> - **Do not remove the pre-filled code**
> - Want to quickly review some of the concepts youâ€™ve been learning? Take a
